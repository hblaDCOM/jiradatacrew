## Insights on the Status of Each Epic and Its Issues

- **EASAMD-22:** This issue has been completed successfully, as confirmed by Sarah's comment. The fixes implemented should positively impact the ongoing workflow for standard changes.

- **EASAMD-177:** Currently in progress, this issue is actively being addressed with ongoing weekly check-in sessions. However, it was noted that visual clarity for testing outcomes needs improvement, indicating an area requiring focus by the assigned resource, Matt.

- **EASAMD-222:** This issue is also in progress, with efforts to conduct vanguard testing under Harrison’s leadership. There is an expressed need for clarity in the testing process, which may impact timelines if not addressed promptly.

- **EASAMD-223:** Completed but labeled as a "Won’t Do." The intention to pivot towards a rewrite of the standard change application is a strategic decision, highlighting the need to meet stakeholder expectations effectively.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Enhance Communication Channels:** Leverage feedback from the ongoing weekly check-ins on EASAMD-177 to address the identified visual clarity issue. Regular updates to and from the team can foster transparency and ensure swift issue resolution.

2. **Testing Coordination:** For EASAMD-222, streamline coordination for the vanguard testing phase. Ensure consistent and clear communication between team members to mitigate any confusion that may delay testing outcomes.

3. **Finalize Documentation:** With two issues marked as done, it is crucial to document key learnings and finalize experience reports. This will serve as a resource for future epics and provide insights into effective operational practices.

## Potential Additional Issues to Create

- **Visual Clarity Improvement Task:** Create an issue focused on enhancing the visual and interaction design aspects identified in EASAMD-177.
  
- **Streamlining Vanguard Testing:** Develop an issue focused on creating a framework for conducting and reporting vanguard tests, ensuring clarity and efficiency.

By implementing these recommendations and tracking additional issues, the epic's primary objectives can be met effectively while continuously improving team processes.
